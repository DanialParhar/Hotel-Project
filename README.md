# Hotel-Project
I created a hotel wifi project on Cisco packet tracer.
The hotel consists of **Eight floors**, and each floor is assigned a dofferent VLANs to ensure proper segmentation, security, and traffic management.
Routers are configured with **OSPF** for inter-floor communication, while DHCP provides dynamic IP addressing.  
  
**Core Devices:**
- 1 Routers
- 1 Core Switch
- 8 Floor Switches
- 16 Access Points (2 for each floor)
- 16 Laptops (2 for each floor)
- 16 Smart Phones (2 for each floor).
